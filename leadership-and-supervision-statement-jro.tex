Getting to work with a diverse group of talented undergraduate and graduate
students and postdocs in my lab is the most rewarding part of my job as a
PI.
I work with each of my lab members to develop an individual development
plan\footnote{\label{idp}\shortfullcite{myIDPonline}} that fits
their level of experience, learning style, and career goals.
Most importantly, I try to create an atmosphere in my lab where
lab members work \emph{with} me, as opposed to \emph{for} me.

I am incredibly lucky to have recruited such an amazing group of students and
postdocs, who make
% my job easy and
our lab group fun and productive.
% While at AU, I have graduated two M.Sc.\ students, Aundrea Westfall
% and Breanna Sipley.
% Aundrea is now a Ph.D.\ student at the University of Texas Arlington,
% and
% Breanna is a Ph.D.\ student and NSF Graduate Research Fellow at the University
% of Idaho.
While at AU, I have graduated two M.Sc.\ students, both of whom are in Ph.D.\
programs, and one was awarded an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.
% I currently have seven Ph.D. students in my lab, two in their 5th
% year (Kerry Cobb and Randy Klabacka), four in their 2nd year
% (Tashitso Anamza, Matt Buehler, Tanner Myers, and Claire Tracy),
% and one in her 1st year (Morgan Muell).
% I also serve on the advisory committee of 10 other graduate students.
% We have had 14 undergraduate student researchers in our lab, including four
% NSF-funded REU students.
% Our first cohort of undergraduate researchers, Charlotte Benedict, Ryan Cook,
% and Miles Horne, are now in biology graduate programs at the Ohio State
% University, Villanova University, and the University of Texas at El Paso.
I currently have seven Ph.D. students in my lab, and serve on the advisory
committee of 10 other graduate students in my department.
We have had 14 undergraduate student researchers in our lab, including four
NSF-funded REU students.
All three students in our first cohort of undergraduate researchers are now in
biology graduate programs.
% Three of these students are still working in the lab,
% and two have moved on to graduate programs.
% I have mentored three postdocs, Jesse Grismer, Brian Folt, and Perry Wood, Jr.
% Jesse is now an Assistant Professor at La Sierra University,
% Brian is in a second postdoc position,
% and Perry is still working in my lab, funded by an NSF award
% (\href{https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1656004&HistoricalAwards=false}{DEB 1656004}).
I have mentored three postdocs.
The first is now an assistant professor at La Sierra University, the second is
in his second postdoc position at the University of Florida, and the third is
still working in my lab, funded by an NSF award
(\href{https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1656004&HistoricalAwards=false}{DEB 1656004}).
