%\section*{Teaching Philosophy}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%My primary objective as an educator is to impart that biology is an open-ended, inquiry-based endeavor that inherently requires critical thinking and creativity.
As an undergraduate tutor, graduate student teaching assistant, workshop
instructor, and lecturer,
I have had the privilege of teaching a variety of biology subjects to a
diversity of undergraduate and graduate students, postdocs, and professors.
While my approach to each subject varies, my primary philosophy remains the
same:
\textbf{\textit{My objective as an educator is to impart that biology is an
open-ended, inquiry-based endeavor that inherently requires critical thinking
and creativity.}}
% As with all fields of science, it is not a subject that can be effectively
% learned from a textbook alone.
I try to blur the distinction between teaching and research and incorporate
active, inquiry-based learning techniques and primary literature into my
teaching at all levels of undergraduate and graduate education.
My goal is not only to teach the subject material, but also expose students to
the venture of science, and hopefully inspire students to consider a
research-based career. 

% \subsection*{My Approach}
My general approach to teaching can be summarized in five components:
% (1) preparation,
% (2) establishing an interactive learning environment,
% (3) conveying concepts,
% (4) making the material relevant,
% and
% (5) measuring success.
\textbf{(1) Preparation}---I always strive to understand the concepts behind,
and the literature beyond, the course material.
% Without a thorough understanding of the subject, good teaching is impossible.
\textbf{(2) Establish learning environment}---I use enthusiasm, discussion
questions, and active-learning exercises to establish a comfortable,
interactive learning environment in the classroom 
% One effective strategy I have found is to be enthusiastic and engaging in my
% presentation of the material; this helps make the experience more enjoyable for
% the students and myself, and is enough to generate classroom participation in
% most cases.
% Using some appropriate humor can aid this process; I have found that making fun
% of myself in a lighthearted manner can be very effective for creating a
% comfortable environment for participation and help make me approachable to the
% students outside of class.
% When I get a group of students that are reluctant to participate, I kindly
% force participation and reward it with positive feedback.
% I do this by frequently asking questions and waiting for their feedback.
% Once the students realize their feedback is required to proceed and is never
% received negatively, even the shyest group of students will get involved.
\textbf{(3) Convey concepts}---My goal is to convey the important principles
and concepts behind the material, and prevent students from simply memorizing
information.
% I have two main strategies for helping students truly understand the material.
To accommodate the diversity of ways in which students learn effectively, I
often present concepts from several different perspectives.
In order to encourage creativity and synthesis of newly acquired knowledge,
I constantly ask questions and incorporate inquiry-based activities that
require the students to go beyond the class material and build upon the
concepts they are learning.
% These questions usually have many correct answers, and so at the same time,
% this strategy can help reinforce participation, because every contribution has
% value.
% The key is to wait for the students to work it out themselves; I will often
% rephrase the question or give hints to guide their path of thought, but I never
% answer the question for them.
% To augment these questions, I incorporate inquiry-based activities and
% information from the primary literature as often as possible. 
\textbf{(4) Make material relevant}---At every opportunity, I relate concepts
to current events, my research, or the research of other members of the
department.
This provides an opportunity for the students to learn about ongoing
research at their institution and how the material is important and relevant.
I also include current literature to convey to the students that topics in
biology are open-ended and constantly advancing.
% Most importantly, I incorporate hands-on activities to teach topics, because
% there is no better way to make a subject relevant than personal experience.
\textbf{(5) Measuring learning success}---I use conceptual inventories to
collect quantitative data on how well students are learning core concepts.
This allows me to test for general patterns of teaching effectiveness, and take
an evidence-based approach to my content, presentation, and exercises.

\subsection*{Teaching Experience}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection*{In the classroom}
As an undergraduate tutor, I helped first-generation and special-needs students
understand key concepts in biology and chemistry classes.
% By working with a diversity of students in one-on-one consultations, I learned
% that every student has a unique way of effectively learning.
% Thus, early on in my career, I realized the need to present ideas from a
% variety of perspectives to accommodate diverse learning styles.
As a graduate student, I taught Herpetology, Biostatistics, and Genetics
to upper-level undergraduate students, and also presented guest lectures for a
graduate-level Evolutionary Biology course.
% These courses have exposed me to a diversity of teaching formats, including
% formal lectures, discussions, and field and computer-based labs.
I was awarded the Kenneth B.\ Armitage Award for Excellence in Teaching; an
award given out each year to an outstanding graduate teaching assistant in the
University of Kansas Division of Biological Sciences that is nominated by their
students.

I have led and assisted in the instruction for several inquiry-based workshops
with the common goal of teaching basic principles of computer programming and
bioinformatics to international groups of graduate students, postdocs, and
faculty.
% I gained experience developing inquiry-based exercises and tutorials
% to help students actively learn difficult concepts.
% I really enjoyed breaking away from my role as a lecturer to become an active
% participant in the exercises along with the students.
As a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Washington (UW), I have
guest lectured for Applied Phylogenetics (BIOL 449) and Biogeography
(BIOL 470), and
% Furthermore, for Applied Phylogenetics, I led an inquiry-based computer lab on
% phylogenetic inference, and developed a learning-assessment survey for the
% course.
% The goal of the survey is to establish baseline data on how well students are
% understanding the fundamental concepts of phylogenetics, and, over time, allow
% for assessing the effectiveness of different teaching strategies and exercises.
I am currently teaching
\href{http://courses.biology.washington.edu/biol180/}{Introductory Biology}
(BIOL 180).
% BIOL 180 is the largest course in UW history, with more than 1200 students
% enrolled.
With the \href{https://sites.google.com/site/uwbioedresgroup/home}{UW Biology
    Education Research Group}, I am developing and implementing active-learning
activities aimed at improving student learning of important concepts in
biology.
I am also using conceptual inventories to quantify the effectiveness of these
activities.
% All of this work is evidence-based, guided by the long history of research on
% biology education at UW.

\subsubsection*{Mentoring}
% As an undergraduate student, I got involved in research projects under the
% mentorship of three different biology faculty members.
% These opportunities provided me with indispensable research experience as an
% aspiring young scientist.
% Understanding how critical my undergraduate research experience was in
% preparing me for graduate school, I am always excited to get motivated
% undergraduates involved in my research.

% As a Ph.D. student, I mentored local high school students and undergraduates
% in the methods of field research and the management of scientific collections.
% These students volunteered to help collect specimens, genetic samples, and
% ecological data from reptiles and amphibians from across the Central Great
% Plains.
% Two of the high school students subsequently enrolled in KU, and under my
% supervision, were employed as curatorial assistants in the KU Herpetology
% Collection.
% Furthermore, I helped Liz Lusher obtain a KU Undergraduate Research Award to
% study the phylogeography of ringneck snakes (\emph{Diadophis punctatus}) across
% Kansas.
% With my guidance, she successfully completed the project and presented her
% results at the KU Undergraduate Research Symposium.
As a Ph.D. student, I mentored students in the methods of field-based
biodiversity research, including high school, undergraduate, and graduate
students from De Soto High School, University of Kansas, Universiti Kebangsaan
Malaysia, Universiti Sains Malaysia, and La Sierra University.
% I found this experience to be particularly rewarding, and I aspire to get
% undergraduate and graduate students involved with international and local
% fieldwork projects as often as possible.

\subsection*{Prospective Courses}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

I am excited to develop and teach my own courses, because they give me the
opportunity to inspire young students to pursue science.
% I owe my career in biology to my introductory biology professor, Dr.\ Scott
% Snyder, whose enthusiastic teaching style convinced me as a freshman
% undergraduate to pursue a biology major and undergraduate research projects.
% I aspire to provide the same positive experience for young students.
My research and teaching experiences have prepared me to teach a number of
courses for undergraduate and graduate students.
I am comfortable teaching a variety of undergraduate classes, including
Introductory Biology, Zoology, Herpetology, Genetics, Evolution, Phylogenetics,
and Biostatistics.
For more advanced undergraduate and graduate students, I would like to develop
courses that focus on theory and methods of statistical genetics,
bioinformatics, biologically focused computer programming, and advanced
statistical topics like maximum likelihood and Bayesian statistics.
