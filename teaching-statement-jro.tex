\section*{Teaching Philosophy}
%%%%%%%%%%%
The core of my teaching philosophy can be summarized in four components:
1) preparation,
2) establish a healthy learning environment,
3) convey concepts, and
4) make material relevant.

\subsubsection*{Preparation}
The foundation of good teaching is knowledge and preparation.
I always strive to understand the concepts behind, and the literature beyond, the course material.
Without a thorough understanding of the subject, good teaching is impossible.

\subsubsection*{Establish learning environment}
Establishing a comfortable, interactive learning environment in the classroom takes practice and is different for every group of students.
One effective strategy I have found is to be enthusiastic and engaging in my presentation of the material; this helps make the experience more enjoyable for the students and myself, and is enough to generate classroom participation in most cases.
Using some appropriate humor can aid this process; I have found that making fun of myself in a lighthearted manner can be very effective for creating a comfortable environment for participation and help make me approachable to the students outside of class.
When I get a group of students that are recalcitrant to participate, I kindly force participation and reward it with positive feedback.
I do this by frequently asking questions and waiting for their feedback.
Once the students realize their feedback is required to proceed and is never received negatively, even the shyest group of students will get involved.

\subsubsection*{Convey concepts}
My goal in the classroom, office hours, and review sessions is to convey the important principles and concepts behind the material.
I will do everything possible to prevent students from simply memorizing information from the course materials.
I have two main strategies for helping students truly understand the material.
First, I present concepts from several different perspectives, trying to accommodate the diversity of ways in which students learn effectively.
Second, I hold students accountable for synthesizing their newly acquired knowledge; I constantly ask questions that require the students to go beyond the class material and build upon the concepts they are learning.
These questions usually have many correct answers, and so at the same time, this strategy can help reinforce participation, because every contribution has value.
The key is to wait for the students to work it out themselves; I will often rephrase the question or give hints to guide their path of thought, but I never answer the question for them.

\subsubsection*{Make material relevant}
At every opportunity, I relate the material we are discussing to current events, my research, or the research of other members of the department.
This provides an opportunity for the students to get to know more about what I and other people in the department do, and illustrates why the material is important and relevant to everyday life.

\section*{Teaching Appointments \& Evaluation Comments}
%During my time at KU, I have had the privilege of assisting in the teaching of introductory courses in Biostatistics (Biology 570) and Genetics (Biology 350).
%In the Fall of 2009, I was responsible for three lab sections of Biostatistics.
%In Spring and Fall of 2010, I was responsible for two and three discussion sections of Genetics.
%Below are a selection of comments from my students from each appointment.
